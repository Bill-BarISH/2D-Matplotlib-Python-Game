# 2D-Matplotlib-Python-Game
This is a simple game that i have designed and coded ip python. My code uses Matplotlib to play GIF animations. Controls are very simple: when you press 'space' button, the animation stops and and the last frame number is saved into a variable, and then the value of the variable determines what happens next. Feel free to use my code!
