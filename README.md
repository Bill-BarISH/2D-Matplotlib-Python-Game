# 2D-Matplotlib-Python-Game
Im only few month into learning Python and i was wondering if i could make a game with it.
I didnt know about any libraries created specifically for developing games at the time, 
so i asked an AI if i could somehow make a code that opens and plays GIF animations.
AI came up with a function that opens GIFs as matplotlib plots.
I added a condition that if 'space' button is pressed,
the animation stops and the last frame number is saved into a variable, 
and then the value of the variable determines what happens next.
This whole game is built around this simple algorithm.
Im planning to update the game.
Feel free to use the code and please watch my showcase video!
